            <!-- <p>I'll say a few words about my most time-intensive hobby: Singing as a member of Granite State Choral Society. Based out of Rochester, NH, "Granite State Choral Society exists to create accessible social experiences that educate, connect and inspire all generations through the power of song." Apologies for the spiel-like quality of that last bit, but I am a member of the GSCS Board of Trustees and I like ot plug the org whenever i can! (website is <a href="https://gschoralsociety.org">gschoralsociety.org</a> btw). I am by far the youngest member of the chorus, and I get a real kick out of being a huge outlier in the distribution of ages in the group.. one lone 24 year-old in a sea of 50+ year-olds (although all ages 12+ are welcome). The chorus has undertaken many ambitious projects including Mozart's Requiem, Carmina Burana, and an entire body of work commissioned for the city of Rochester that tells the history of the area (and as a result the broader history of small-town New England.) If you are into choral music or are trying to get a good taste of what the local arts scene has to offer I highly recommend that you check out GSCS.</p> -->
